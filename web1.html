    <p>
        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It provides the structure and content that web browsers render to users. HTML documents consist of elements represented by tags, which define headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, tables, and more. HTML attributes provide additional information about elements, such as style, behavior, or functionality. HTML is essential for building websites and web applications, offering platform independence, ease of use, and flexibility. By following best practices like using semantic HTML, valid HTML, and accessibility features, developers can create robust, flexible, and maintainable web pages. HTML is the backbone of the web, and understanding its concepts and syntax is crucial for web development.

    <p>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language used to control the layout and appearance of web pages. It allows developers to separate presentation from structure, making it easier to maintain and update websites. CSS is used to style HTML elements, applying visual styles such as colors, fonts, spacing, and more. CSS rules consist of selectors, properties, and values, which determine how elements are styled. CSS offers various features like media queries for responsive design, pseudo-classes for dynamic styling, and CSS frameworks for rapid development. By mastering CSS, developers can create visually appealing, user-friendly, and responsive web applications that provide a great user experience. CSS is a fundamental technology for web development, and its applications are vast and diverse.

        JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language used for client-side scripting on the web. It allows developers to create interactive web pages, web applications, and mobile applications. JavaScript is used to add dynamic effects, animate elements, respond to user interactions, and update content on web pages. It's a fundamental technology for web development, alongside HTML and CSS. JavaScript frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js provide pre-built functionality and tools to speed up development. With Node.js, JavaScript can also be used for server-side programming, making it a versatile language for full-stack development. JavaScript's versatility, dynamic nature, and widespread adoption make it a popular choice for web development.
